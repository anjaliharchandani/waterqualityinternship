# Water Quality Prediction - AICTE Internship Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the AICTE Internship program for June 2025. The aim is to predict the quality of water using machine learning techniques based on various physical and chemical features.

## 📁 Files Included
- `water_quality_prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with all code, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `water_quality.csv` — Dataset used (optional, if included).
- `README.md` — This file.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Predict whether water is safe to drink based on features such as:
- pH
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Approach
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Handled missing values and outliers.
3. Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
4. Built classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
5. Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## ✅ Outcome
Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** using [Best Model Name].
